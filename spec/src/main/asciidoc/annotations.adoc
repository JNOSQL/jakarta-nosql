=== Models Annotation

As mentioned previously, the Mapping API has annotations that make the Java developer's life easier; these annotations have two categories:

* Annotation Models
* Qualifier annotation

==== Annotation Models

The annotation model is to convert the entity model to the entity on communication, the communication entity:


* Entity
* Column
* MappedSuperclass
* Id
* Embeddable
* Convert


The Jakarta NoSQL Mapping does not require the getter and setter methods to the fields, however, the Entity class must have a non-private constructor with no parameters.

===== Entity

This annotation maps the class to Eclipse Jakarta NoSQL. It has a unique attribute called `name`. This attribute is to inform either the column family name or the document collection name, etc. The default value is the simple name of a class; for example, given the org.jakarta.nosql.demo.Person class, the default name will be `Person`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Entity("name")
public class Person {
}
----

An entity as a field will incorporate as a sub-entity. E.g., In a document, this entity field will convert to a subdocument.


[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Address address;

}


@Entity
public class Address {

    @Column
    private String street;

    @Column
    private String city;

}
----


[source,json]
----
{
    "_id":10,
    "name":"Ada Lovelave",
    "address":{
        "city":"São Paulo",
        "street":"Av nove de julho"
    }
}
----
===== Column

This annotation defines which fields that belong an Entity will be persisted. There is an unique attribute name that specifies the name on Database, and the default value is the field name.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {
    @Column
    private String nickname;
    @Column("native_mapper")
    private String name;
    @Column
    private List<String> phones;
    //ignored
    private String address;
}
----

===== MappedSuperclass

The class with the annotation MapperSuperclass will have all attributes considered as an extension of his subclass with Entity annotation. In this case, all attributes are going to be stored, even the attributes inside the Super Class.


[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Dog extends Animal {

    @Column
    private String name;

}

@MappedSuperclass
public class Animal {

    @Column
    private String race;

    @Column
    private Integer age;


}
----

In this sample above, when saving a Dog instance, it saves the Animal case too; explicitly, will save the fields `name`, `race`, and `age`.


===== Id

The example below shows which attribute is the id, or the key in key-value types. Thus, the value will be the remaining information. It has an attribute as the Column to define the native name. However, the default value of this annotation is `_id`. The way of storing the class will depend on the database driver.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class User implements Serializable {

    @Id
    private String userName;

    private String name;

    private List<String> phones;
    }
----


===== Embeddable

Defines a class whose instances are stored as an intrinsic part of an owning entity and share the identity of the object.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Book {

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Author author;


}

@Embeddable
public class Author {

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private Integer age;


}
----

===== Convert

As Communication, the Mapping API has a converter at abstraction level. This feature is useful, e.g., to cipher a field, String to String, or just to do a conversion to a custom type using annotation. The Converter annotation has a parameter, and an AttributeConverter implementation class can be used. E.g., the sample below shows how to create a converter to a custom Money class.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Worker {
    @Column
    private String name;
    @Column
    private Job job;
    @Column("money")
    @Convert(MoneyConverter.class)
    private Money salary;
}

public class MoneyConverter implements AttributeConverter<Money, String>{
    @Override
    public String convertToDatabaseColumn(Money attribute) {
        return attribute.toString();
    }
    @Override
    public Money convertToEntityAttribute(String dbData) {
        return Money.parse(dbData);
    }
}
public class Money {
    private final String currency;

    private final BigDecimal value;

//....
}
----

===== Collection


The Mapping layer has support for `java.util.Collection` to both simple elements such as `String`, `Integer`, that will send to the communication API the exact value and class that has fields inside, once the class has either `Entity` or `Embedded` annotation; otherwise, will post as the first scenario, like String or any amount without converter process.

It has support to:

* `java.util.Deque`
* `java.util.Queue`
* `java.util.List`
* `java.util.Iterable`
* `java.util.NavigableSet`
* `java.util.SortedSet`
* `java.util.Collection`


[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Person {

    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column
    private String name;

    @Column
    private List<String> phones;

    @Column
    private List<Address> address;
}


@Embeddable
public class Address {

    @Column
    private String street;

    @Column
    private String city;

}
----



[source,json]
----
{
    "_id": 10,
    "address":[
        {
            "city":"São Paulo",
            "street":"Av nove de julho"
        },
        {
            "city":"Salvador",
            "street":"Rua Engenheiro Jose Anasoh"
        }
    ],
    "name":"Name",
    "phones":[
        "234",
        "432"
    ]
}
----
==== Qualifier annotation

That is important to work with more than one type of the same application.

[source,java]
----
@Inject
private DocumentRepository repositoryA;
@Inject
private DocumentRepository repositoryB;
----

Two injections with the same interface, CDI throws an ambiguous exception. There is the `Database` qualifier to fix this problem. It has two attributes:

* *DatabaseType*: The database type, key-value, document, column, graph.
* *provider*: The provider's database name, e.g., "cassandra", "hbase", "mongodb". So, using the `Database` qualifier:


[source,java]
----
@Inject
@Database(value = DatabaseType.DOCUMENT, provider = “databaseA”)
private DocumentRepository repositoryA;
@Inject
@Database(value = DatabaseType.DOCUMENT, provider = “databaseB”)
private DocumentRepository repositoryB;
----

Beyond this annotation, the producer method with the entity manager is required.

The benefit of using this qualifier instead of creating a new one is that if the Manager Entity is produced using `Database` as a qualifier, it will create classes such as DocumentRepository, ColumnRepository, etc. automatically.
